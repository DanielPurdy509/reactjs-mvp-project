# ReactJS - MVP Project



A MVP website built over the course of two days.

Modeled after a photo portfolio website for a photographer using photos provided by me.

Includes seperate "page" displays for a home/landing page, about page, and the gallery page. All navigation is done through a fixed nav bar.

All photo information, including image sources, image descriptions, dates, and photo titles are stored through a single-table database.

Data is accessed from the database via an Express.js server. Currently there is only routing for retrieving all the database files.

Project was not deployed
